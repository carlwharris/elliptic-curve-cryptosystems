# elliptic-curve-cryptosystems
A MATLAB implementation of the basic elliptic curve encryption process on simple, user-defined curves.

This respository contains my final project for Math 31: Topic in Algebra (Dartmouth College, Fall 2020), in which I provide an overview of elliptic curve cryptography and implement a simple elliptic curve cryptosystem in MATLAB. 

The project text is "ECC Project Paper," which contains an example of program usage and output. The results corresponding to Section 3, "Elliptic Curve Subgroups," can be obtained by running "SubgroupMain.m" in the "Subgroup Example" folder. Those corresponding to Section 4, "Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems: Theory and MATLAB Implementation," are generated by "EncryptionMain.m" in the "Encryption Example" folder. Function details can be found in the comments, and code sources are referenced in the corresponding section of the paper.
